# JavaScript Sandbox

This is a sandbox environment where I practice vanilla JavaScript concepts.

This repo is meant to serve as a place for me to learn but also to demonstrate
some of the skills I have aquired in the JavaScript ecosystem. As such, I only use AI
as an enhanced google search when writing this code, as any additional use of AI to
write code for me would defeat both of these purposes.

Some of this code is over-engineered. Some of these apps use patterns that are 
unessesary, and in many of these projects, I am re-inventing the wheel. This is
all intentional for the sake of my own learning.

Below are some of the practice projects that are functional enough to demonstrate.

Factory pattern and module pattern:  
[tictactoe](https://tanner-denti.github.io/javascript-sandbox/factory-module-patterns/)

Webpack, pub-sub pattern, and client side local storage:  
[todolist](https://tanner-denti.github.io/javascript-sandbox/webpack-project-local-storage/dist/)  

Notes:
- Webpack prod /dist directories aren't on seperate branches only because of the way I decided to structure this parent repo.
